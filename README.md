#Midterm Submission Report

Week 1 Assignment: Math and Graphs with Python

Creating Data: Wrote code to initialize lists of numbers and matrices, including generating arrays with random values and zeros.

Doing Math: Performed various calculations such as addition, multiplication, and finding averages on these arrays using NumPy.

Speed Test: Demonstrated that using NumPy’s vectorized operations is significantly faster than using standard Python loops.

Plotting: Created a line graph to visualize temperature changes over time.

Week 2 Assignment: Statistics and Prediction

Salary Study: Analyzed a theoretical regression model for starting salaries. I determined that, based on the model's interaction terms, males earned higher average salaries than females specifically when GPAs were high.

Car Data: Processed real automotive data to investigate the relationship between engine power and fuel efficiency.

The Result: My analysis using OLS regression confirmed a statistically significant negative relationship, showing that as horsepower increases, gas mileage (MPG) decreases.
