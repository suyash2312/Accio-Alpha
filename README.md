## Midterm Submission Report
### Week 1: Math and Graphs with Python

In week 1, I used Python and NumPy to work with data types like lists, matrices, random arrays, and zero arrays. Performed simple math operations such as addition, multiplication, and finding averages. Also checked the speed difference between Python loops and NumPy operations and found that NumPy is much faster for arrays than using arrays directly.
Along with this, I solved a probability and statistics assignment. It was a written assignment.Finally, I also plotted a line graph to show how temperature changes over time.

### Week 2: Statistics and Prediction

In week 2, I worked on basic statistics and linear regression. Analyzed a salary model and observed that males had higher average salaries than females when GPA was high,it was concluded based on the interaction term, there were other terms as well each with their significance.
I also worked with a car dataset to study the relation between horsepower and mileage. From the regression results, found that mileage decreases as horsepower increases, and the relationship was statistically significant.
