## Midterm Submission Report
### Week 1: Math and Graphs with Python

In this assignment, I worked with Python and NumPy to create and handle different types of data. I created lists, matrices, random arrays, and arrays filled with zeros. I then performed basic mathematical operations like addition, multiplication, and calculating averages.

I also compared normal Python loops with NumPy operations and observed that NumPy works much faster. Along with this, I solved a probability and statistics assignment, which helped me revise basic concepts like averages, distributions, and data analysis.

Finally, I plotted a simple line graph to show how temperature changes over time.

### Week 2: Statistics and Prediction

For this week, I studied a regression model related to starting salaries. From the analysis, I found that males tend to earn higher salaries than females when the GPA is high, based on the interaction terms in the model.

I also analyzed a real car dataset to understand how engine power affects fuel efficiency. Using OLS regression, I found that as horsepower increases, the mileage (MPG) decreases, and this relationship was statistically significant.
